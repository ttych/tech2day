I created a new simple theme for Tech2day.
This was the occasion to discover:
- **CSS-3**
  + learn base principle of CSS
  + learn base principle of Sass
  + layout using flex and grid
- **Jekyll**
  + discover collection behavior and limitation
  + default behavior on posts
  + discover pagination

This is a first improvement.

It will continue to evolve until I change it for something else,
keeping the content.
