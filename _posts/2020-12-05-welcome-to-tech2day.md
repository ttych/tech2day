I started this site to keep track of all computer related topics I'm
working on day after day.

I start it in english but I will try to have it working in 2 language.

Tech2day is for `Tech today`. What are the computer technical topic I
have worked on, discovered today.

Doing it will help to :
- keep track of what I am working
- improve my skills on explaining/presenting technical information
- clarify my mind on the topic

I am working as system engineer, developer, agilist. So I will cover
mainly those 3 themes.

Thank you for reading me ;)
